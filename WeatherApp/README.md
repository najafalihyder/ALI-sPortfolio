# 🌦️ Real-Time Weather App using Python & Weather API

A simple, clean weather app built in Python that allows users to input **any city in the world** and instantly see the current weather conditions using a **live Weather API**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Input any city name — fetch weather globally
- ✅ Real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.)
- ✅ Uses live API for accurate results
- ✅ Simple, intuitive interface
- ✅ Lightweight and fast

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **API**: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) *(or your used API)*
- **Libraries**: `requests`, `json`, `streamlit` (if Streamlit UI), `datetime`

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/najafalihyder/ALI-sPortfolio/tree/main/WeatherApp.git
   cd weather-app

Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app (CLI or Streamlit):
python weather_app.py



streamlit run weather_app.py
🧠 How It Works
Takes user input (city name)

Calls Weather API to fetch live data

Parses the JSON response

Displays temperature, humidity, description, etc.

📬 Note
You’ll need an API key from your weather provider — paste it into the code in the api_key variable.
